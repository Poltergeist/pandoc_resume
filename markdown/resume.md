Also we have build a application to run github actions on jenkins to ease the migration to github actions. At one point the team was disassambled and I was moved to the Cloud Platform team. In the Cloud Platform team I have worked on several projects which were focused towards using a multi account strategy with aws for new work and help with the migration from the datacenter to the cloud.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **JavaScript / TypeScript:** I have worked in the past 11 years mostly with JavaScript or TypeScript, I have at least touched the most used frameworks like angular, vue.js and react. But I have also worked a fair amount of vanilla JS applications. And I have worked with the not so broad used library Closure. My longest time however I have worked with react and vanilla JS, I have touched most of the libraries interconnected with react. But I am very certain that I can get up to speed with any library in JavaScript in a rather short amount of time. I have also worked with RxJS and GraphQl and I do understand the concepts behind these libraries. JavaScript is definitely my strong suit.

:   **Go:** I have used Go for multiple projects during my career, I am not super profound in Go but I have a little more then a basic knowledge of the language and want to extend my knowledge further. 

:   Knowledge necessary for building things: **HTML**, **CSS(and most of the preprocessors)**

:   Very basic knowledge of **Lua**, **Elixir / Erlang**, **Python**, **Ruby**

Side Projects
:   **heart-for-coding (1kJS):** I once tried to build something meaningful in less then 1k of JS and the result
    of this challenge is [heart for coding](http://poltergeist.github.io/heart-for-coding/) 
:   **Jp-tournament**: A tournament software based on github actions to test run a tournament system mostly used for multiplayer games in Japan. This was used for personal assesment of the tournament system and see if it could be used in Europe aswell.
